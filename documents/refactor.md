- Add comments throughout various controllers explaining nested pieces of code
- Add useful comments throughout all client side javascript explaining what each function does and where the code it relies on lives
- Add a docsify that explains all endpoints and how to access them
- Add a couple of custom middlewares that help to made certain variables more DRY
- Refactor Twitter function and try to implement it in a way that works as intended
