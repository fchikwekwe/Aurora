## Jackson's suggestion for tests

- write tests to see if photos save
- stress testing inputs
- write tests to see if API is actually returning landmarks and facial boundaries
- writing tests for Oauth to see if I am actually communicating with API properly
- write test to make sure that my request is valid before its sent out
- write test for nodemailer to make sure emails are being sent
- write client side test for conversion of Base64 url to blob
