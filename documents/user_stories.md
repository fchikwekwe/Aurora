Hi, I'm Bella the beauty guru and I often have to apply makeup while on the go. I usually carry a full kit with me, including a small mirror, but sometimes I need better lighting in dark spaces. I tried FaceSpace because it was recommended to me by a friend. I like it because its a quick, convenient solution to poor lighting when I'm touching up my makeup.

Hi, I'm Corey the casual consumer. I only use a few products on my face: eyeliner, concealer and a beauty blender. Sometimes when I'm out, I have to make sure my concealer is still doing its job. I wasn't sure about FaceSpace, but I do like new tech tools. FaceSpace is cool because its modern and easy to use when I need to see my face better.

Hello, I'm Fawn the full-face fashionista. I never leave the house without my make-up perfectly in place. I usually touchup my makeup 2-3 times before I get back home in the evening. While I never forget my mirror, sometimes I need an extra tool to make sure everything is in place. I use FaceSpace to check my makeup before I reapply and to make sure that I'm getting every spot.
